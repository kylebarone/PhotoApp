# PhotoApp

A project built to practice developing a microservice architecture using spring boot. Is solely a backend structure with postman used to simulate http requests. Is configured to additionally be hosted via AWS servers however those have been deactivated for cost reasons.

I have structured my git repo as monolithic however the following directories are seperate microservices that make up the application.
